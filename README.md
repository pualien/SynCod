# SynCod
SynCod is a software whose aim is to help writing code in a group of developers working in a LAN environment.

Its main feature consists in having multiple users (developers) open the same file simultaneously, thus enabling every user to see, in real time, all the changes to that particular file made by the other users.

SynCod is also provided with a Chat, which is useful to coordinate and discuss the work done on a particular file.

The Graphical User Interface is really simple. However, for those who want to have a better grasp on the functionalities of SynCod, we have written this proper Wiki to help everyone who is interested in our work.

## Usage
